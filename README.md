Python Challenge - Module 3
This project is proving two seperate bits of information. 

The PyBank challenge offers up information based upon monthy totals for a 'PNL' or Profit and Loss Statement. This python code can receive monthly financials of whether a company operated with profits or losses and in return will output key information such as: the Total Months, Net Total, Average Change, Greatest Increase and Greatest Decrease. 

The PyPolll challenge offers up a different set of information, this time around voting metrics. In a country that has fears over its elections being "rigged" it is important to have code such as this one. This python can input thousands of ballots and return an output of: Each Vote Getter, their Totals and Percetanges of All Votes. On top of that it will return the Winner of the election.

This file is run via VS Code in the langauge of Python. By running this code, users can see the output below and also in the file within the analysis folder.

I recieved help from Google, my Main tutor and the AskBCS tutors.
